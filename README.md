# Stout_Case_Study

Here is all the code and visuals for Stout Case Study.

For the case-1 visualization, I would like to add a few comments here.
It's easy to understand that with higher annual revenew, and better credit history, it is more likely to yield a lower interest rate. 
One fun fact I noticed is about whether loan individually or jointly.
The website recommended to loan jonitly to provide a lower interest rate, while the plot showed that the average joint intererst rate is even higher than individual interest rate. 
This is probably due to the fact that people with worse record and less annual income are more likely to look for someone esle to loan together. From this perspective, such situation can be explained.
